# Abstract
Climate change has emerged as a significant global concern, attracting increasing attention worldwide. Following the Great Recession, the term Green Bubble emerged in academic literature, denoting situations marked by excessive investments in renewable energy sources.
While these phenomena can be examined through a social bubble hypothesis, it is essential not to neglect a Climate Minsky moment triggered by sudden asset price changes. The recent boom in green investing highlights the importance of having an exhaustive understanding of such phenomena. Consequently, this article aims to investigate bubble stages within the renewable energy sector. It presents a novel perspective on bubble detection and investigates the potential propagation effects on the stability of the financial system through econometric models. By exploring bubble dynamics, this research provides relevant policy implications. Drawing inspiration from Joseph Schumpeter's ideas on business cycles, the existence of green bubbles should be recognized as a ''*necessary evil*'' for the successful transition to a greener future.
